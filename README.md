# Bmp2Excel-Image-Converter

## Program Objective:
This program takes a .bmp image file and parses/stores the file bytes into a .csv file. This .csv file can then be opened with excel. Then using Excels inbuilt conditional color formatting rules you can turn the pixel data into glorious images.  
Why?...well, why not?  

## Program Background:
I got the initial idea of this project after watching this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I  
The math teacher, turned comedian Matt Parker, shows a excel spreadsheet image of his face as a demonstration on LCD pixels. I thought this was a cool demostration, but wanted to do it without all the tedious work that Mr. Parker went through. I also wanted to create a program to easily convert any image into this spreadsheet.

This program is the result.

You too can run this program by git cloning this respository, and compiling the code included.

## Program
Here is a few examples and images showing the output of the program.

## Future Plans

I have a lot of future plans for this project. I think its a great first step into data processing, and manipulating the data of these images. I plan to look into expanding this project into other formats including jpeg, or png.  

This project also is a good base for later image manipulation. The pixel data made from creating the spreadsheets can also be put into other more USEFUL purposes.  In the future I plan to add image editing tools such as resizing, croping, or image filteration.
