# Bmp2Excel-Image-Converter

## Program Objective:
This program takes a .bmp image file and parses/stores the file bytes into a .csv file. This .csv file can then be opened with excel. Excel has inbuilt "Conditional Formatting" that can be applied to make the image appear in excel.  

## Program Background:
I got the initial idea of this project after watching this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2QQHlQ_I  
The math teacher turned comedian Matt Parker shows a excel spreadsheet image of his face in the later half as a demonstration of pixel information. I thought this was a cool study of pixels and image data, but wanted to do it without all the tedious work that Mr. Parker went through. I also wanted to create a program to easily convert any image into this spreadsheet. 


This program is the result.

You can run this program by git cloning this respository, and compiling the code included. 

## Program
Here is a few examples and images showing the output of the program.

## Future Plans

I have a lot of future plans for this project. I think its a great first step into data processing, and manipulating the data of these images. I plan to look into expanding this project into other formats including jpeg, or png.  

This project also would allows a good base for image manipulation. The pixel data that goes into creating the spreadsheets can also be put into other more USEFULL purposes.  In the future I plan to add image editing tools such as resizing, croping, or image filteration.
