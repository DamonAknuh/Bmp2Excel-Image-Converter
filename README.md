# Bmp2Excel-Image-Converter
## Project Overview:
This program takes one .bmp (Bitmap image file) and converts and parses the data into an .csv file. The .csv file can then be opened with excel, and conditionally formatting can be applied to the rows of pixels untill the image comes out.

## Learning Goals:
These are the learning goals I have for this project. 

  * Refresher on C++ coding  
  * Header File Basics  
  * File IO refresher  
  * Navigating Different File Formats
